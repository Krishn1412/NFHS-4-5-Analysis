# NFHS-4-5-Analysis
### 
This research primarily investigates the role of
different menstrual products on pregnancy conditions, and any
possible complications, by corroborating it with the IABR dataset
in NFHS-4 and NFHS-5. The attributes that stood out surrounded
the different components of menstruation, pregnancy complications, birth issues, hemoglobin levels, mother’s age, and delivery
costs and circumstances are used to find associations between
menstrual products (like cloth, sanitary napkins, tampons, menstrual cups, local prepping, none) and pregnancy complications
(vaginal bleeding, convulsions, prolonged labor, severe abdominal pain, high blood pressure). In order to draw insightful
conclusions from our datasets we performed clustering, to explain
the distribution of period products over different chosen clusters
and association rule mining, to establish association rules for the
attributes of interest. Temporal analysis was also performed using
regression to understand the behavior according to the variations
in the attributes over time.
